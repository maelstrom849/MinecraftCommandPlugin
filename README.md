# MinecraftCommandPlugin
Plugin for Minecraft which implements commands


Custom-made for a specific server, but can be adapted easily by substituting the world name in the Spawn file.

Current commands:
/spawn (teleport to spawn)
/setspawnpoint (set point to spawn at)
/tpa (prompt another player to teleport to them)
