# MinecraftCommandPlugin
Plugin for Minecraft which implements commands


Custom-made for a specific server, but can be adapted easily by substituting the world name in the Spawn file.

Current commands:

/setspawnpoint (set point to spawn at) (ADMIN ONLY)

/spawn (teleport to spawn)

/tp (teleport to coordinates)

/tpa (prompt another player to teleport to them)



Currently in version 0.4
